# Phase 5: Project Development Phase

This folder contains the complete, production-ready codebase for **BlogForge - AI Powered Debt Relief & Financial Recovery Platform**, organized into backend and frontend components.

---

## 1. Codebase Structure

The source code is organized into two primary subdirectories:

### 📁 Backend (`backend/`)
Built with Python FastAPI, SQLite (local), and SQLAlchemy ORM.
*   **`app/main.py`**: API routes for JWT authentication, user profiles, loan management, and AI letter generation.
*   **`app/models.py`**: Relational SQLAlchemy database models mapping to the SQLite/Postgres tables.
*   **`app/schemas.py`**: Pydantic validation schemas.
*   **`app/auth.py`**: User authentication utility functions utilizing direct `bcrypt` password hashing and JWT encoding/decoding.
*   **`app/services/financial_engine.py`**: Business logic calculators for DTI ratios, EMI ratios, surplus cash flow, and rule-based predictions.
*   **`app/services/gemini_service.py`**: Google Gemini API client integration for hardship letter compilation, complete with a high-fidelity local mockup generator fallback.
*   **`tests/`**: Pytest automated unit tests verifying calculator boundaries.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies list.
*   **`run.py`**: FastAPI server startup execution script.

### 📁 Frontend (`frontend/`)
Built with React.js (Vite) and Vanilla CSS.
*   **`src/index.css`**: Design Token styling utilizing responsive grids, HSL variable systems, custom neon glows, glassmorphic cards, and keyframe animations.
*   **`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`**: Manages session state, local tokens, user registrations, and dynamic API URL lookups.
*   **`src/pages/Login.jsx` & `Register.jsx`**: User credentials management views.
*   **`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`**: Commands summary cards, loan tables, CRUD modals, and the custom SVG visual gauge of the borrower's distress score.
*   **`src/pages/SettlementPredictor.jsx`**: Displays target settlement amounts, warning badges, comparison bars, and structured lump-sum vs. installment payment plans.
*   **`src/pages/LetterGenerator.jsx`**: UI for AI letter generation inputs, displaying suggested bulleted strategies, and buttons to copy or download files.
*   **`src/pages/History.jsx`**: Accordion logs of past generated letters.
*   **`vercel.json`**: SPA routing rewrite rules for Vercel edge deployment.

## 2. Core Functional Features Implemented
1.  **JWT Authentication**: Secure login and registration with hashed password persistence.
2.  **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time evaluation of total debt liabilities, gross income, and basic living expenses.
3.  **Visual Stress Meter**: Custom animated dial reflecting the borrower's debt distress score based on calculated DTI and EMI ratios.
4.  **Adaptive Settlement Predictor**: Suggests realistic target settlement percentages (ranging from 35% to 85%) based on delinquency duration, loan type (secured vs. unsecured), and financial stress.
5.  **Structured Payoff Plans**: Automatically breaks down predicted settlement values into immediate single lump-sum payoffs vs. structured 3-month or 6-month payment schedules.
6.  **AI Negotiation Letter Generator**: Triggers Google Gemini API to draft professional, personalized hardship letters using input parameters and custom text inputs.
7.  **Auto Fallback Engine**: If the Gemini API key is missing or offline, the local mock generator automatically runs, compiling letters without throwing server crashes.
8.  **Audit Logs & History**: Expandable accordion log list showing all past proposal documents.
