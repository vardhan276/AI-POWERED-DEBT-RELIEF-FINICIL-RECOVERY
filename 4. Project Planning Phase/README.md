## 2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### Sprint 1: Backend Initialization & Database Modeling
*   Set up FastAPI folder structure, define python dependency packages, and initialize virtual environment (`venv`).
*   Establish configuration scripts (`config.py`) to read environment variables and API keys.
*   Define SQLAlchemy database models (`models.py`) reflecting the 6 target relational tables.
*   Establish session makers and database engines inside `database.py`.

### Sprint 2: Core Calculations & Security Layer
*   Write mathematical algorithms inside `financial_engine.py` to evaluate monthly surpluses, DTI ratios, and EMI parameters.
*   Integrate direct `bcrypt` password verification and generate token structures inside `auth.py`.
*   Implement JWT-header parsing dependencies to authenticate API endpoints.

### Sprint 3: Generative AI & API Routing
*   Integrate the Google Gemini SDK inside `gemini_service.py` to compile letters and strategies in JSON format.
*   Write the rule-based local backup text generator to handle offline runs without crashing.
*   Declare CRUD API routers inside `main.py` covering user profiles, loan items, predictions, and negotiation history logs.

### Sprint 4: Frontend Development & Dials
*   Scaffold the React project using Vite and write global Token CSS scripts inside `index.css`.
*   Build the `AuthContext` to handle register actions and persist login keys.
*   Develop user pages: `Login`, `Register`, and `Dashboard`.
*   Write custom SVG elements on the dashboard to render the animated debt stress level gauge.

### Sprint 5: Predictor, Generator & History Logs
*   Develop the `SettlementPredictor` page to show target savings and payment timeline structures.
*   Develop the `LetterGenerator` page with dropdowns for hardships and buttons to copy or download output files.
*   Develop the `History` page utilizing expanding accordion containers for historical audits.

### Sprint 6: Testing, Restructuring & Deployments
*   Write unit tests in `pytest` to verify math boundaries (Low vs Severe stress indices).
*   Compile React assets using `npm run build` to verify syntax and path configurations.
*   Deploy backend to Railway, configure environment variables, and create public DNS endpoints.
