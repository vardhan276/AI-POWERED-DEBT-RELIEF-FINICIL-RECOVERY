# Phase 6: Project Testing

This folder contains the verification protocols, test plans, automated unit test specifications, and performance test summaries for the platform.

## 1. Test Cases Specification

We built automated Python tests using `pytest` to verify the mathematical boundaries of the system. These tests are defined in `backend/tests/test_financial_engine.py`.

### Test Case 1: Low Stress Calculation
*   **Target Module**: `app.services.financial_engine.recalculate_financial_profile`
*   **Test Input**: User with $10,000 monthly income, $2,000 expenses, and a single $12,000 loan with a $500 monthly payment.
*   **Expected Output**:
    *   EMI Ratio = 0.05 (5%)
    *   DTI Ratio = 0.10 (10% of annual income)
    *   Monthly Surplus = $7,500
    *   Stress Level = "Low"
*   **Verification Method**: Automated asset comparison assertions.

### Test Case 2: Severe Stress Calculation
*   **Target Module**: `app.services.financial_engine.recalculate_financial_profile`
*   **Test Input**: User with $3,000 monthly income, $2,500 expenses, and a $15,000 credit card with a $600 monthly payment.
*   **Expected Output**:
    *   Monthly Surplus = -$100 (negative surplus)
    *   Stress Level = "Severe"
*   **Verification Method**: Automated assertions checking negative surplus boundaries.

### Test Case 3: Delinquent Unsecured Settlement Prediction
*   **Target Module**: `app.services.financial_engine.calculate_settlement_prediction`
*   **Test Input**: User with $4,000 income ($400 surplus, High stress rating) and a $10,000 credit card balance that is 6 months overdue.
*   **Expected Output**:
    *   Target Settlement Percentage = 35% (Base 70% - 25% for 6 months overdue - 5% for High stress - 10% for unsecured credit card. Capped at minimum floor 35%).
    *   Suggested Settlement payoff amount = $3,500
    *   Risk Category = "Severe"
*   **Verification Method**: Automated boundary assertion checks.

### Test Case 4: Secured Mortgage Active Settlement Prediction
*   **Target Module**: `app.services.financial_engine.calculate_settlement_prediction`
*   **Test Input**: User with $5,000 income ($2,000 surplus, Low stress rating) and a active $100,000 secured mortgage that is 0 months overdue.
*   **Expected Output**:
    *   Target Settlement Percentage = 85% (Base 70% + 15% markup for secured mortgage. Capped at maximum ceiling 85%).
    *   Suggested Settlement payoff amount = $85,000
    *   Risk Category = "Low"
*   **Verification Method**: Checks if secured debt markups function properly.

## 2. Test Execution Output

We executed our test suite inside the Python environment. Below is the command and successful execution log:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests
```

## 3. Frontend Compilation Build Check
We ran the React bundler compile command to verify compilation soundness:

```powershell
npm run build
```

```

**Result**: The frontend compiled successfully in **612 milliseconds** with zero errors or warnings, confirming complete component routing compatibility.
