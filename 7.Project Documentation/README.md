## 2. Installation & Local Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone your GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suryaprabhat/BlogeForge_AI-Debt-Relief.git
cd BlogeForge_AI-Debt-Relief
```

### Step 2: Configure the Backend Environment
1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd "5. Project Development Phase/backend"
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    *   **Windows (PowerShell)**: `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    *   **macOS / Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`
4.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  Configure your environment variables. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` directory:
    ```env
    # Google Gemini API key from AI Studio
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

### Step 3: Configure the Frontend Environment
1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd "../frontend"
    ```
2.  Install the required Node packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend/` directory (for pointing to the local backend during development):
    ```env
    VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

## 3. Running the Applications Locally

To run the application locally, you must start both the backend API server and the frontend client dev server:

### 1. Launch the Backend API (Terminal 1)
Make sure you are in the `/backend` folder and your virtual environment is active, then run:
```bash
python run.py
```
*The FastAPI server will boot and listen on **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`**. You can access the interactive Swagger API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.*

### 2. Launch the Frontend Dev Server (Terminal 2)
Make sure you are in the `/frontend` folder, then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
*Vite will spin up the web client at **`http://localhost:5173/`**. Open this URL in your web browser.*

## 4. User Guide & Core Features

### 1. Account Setup
1.  Click **Create Account** and register with your email and name.
2.  Upon logging in, click **Profile Settings** and configure your **Monthly Income** and **Basic Expenses**. This is crucial for calculating your debt ratios accurately.

### 2. Loan Management
1.  Click **Add Loan Account** on the dashboard.
2.  Enter details of your outstanding balances, active interest rates (APR), monthly EMI obligations, and overdue duration (months delinquent).
3.  The dashboard will automatically update your overall **Total Debt**, **Total monthly EMIs**, and **Monthly Surplus**, and plot your **Debt Distress Level** (Low, Medium, High, or Severe) on the custom visual dial.

### 3. Settlement Prediction
1.  Go to the **Settlement Predictor** page.
2.  Select an active loan. The engine will calculate target payoff values (e.g. 35% to 55% of the total balance) and evaluate your default risk level.
3.  It will display structured payoff plans, detailing single lump-sum payoffs vs. structured 3-month/6-month installment schedules.

### 4. Drafting AI Hardship Letters
1.  Go to the **AI Letter Generator** page.
2.  Select the creditor account, select a primary hardship reason (Job Loss, Medical Issue, etc.), and provide brief supporting details.
3.  Click **Generate**. The Google Gemini API will construct a custom formal proposal.
4.  Copy the compiled letter text or click **Download** to save it as a text file to print or mail to the creditor.
5.  Access past letters at any time on the **History & Logs** tab.
